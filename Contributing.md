# Contributing to Orange Intelligence  

We’re thrilled that you want to contribute to Orange Intelligence! While we don’t have a fully established contribution process at the moment, here’s what it should look like:

## 🛠 Contribution Workflow  

1. **Open an Issue**  
   - Start by opening an issue in this repository.  
   - Use a proper tag to classify your issue:  
     - `ux`: For UI/UX improvements.  
     - `bug`: For bugs or unexpected behavior.  
     - `feature-request`: For new features you'd like to see.  
     - `extension-function`: For proposing new functions/extensions to be added to the floating window.  
   - Wait for feedback before diving into implementation. We don’t want you to waste valuable time on something that might not align with the project’s goals.  

2. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Once your issue is approved, fork the repository and start working on your changes.  
   - When ready, submit a PR linked to your issue.  

3. **Make the CI Happy**  
   - Ensure your code passes all linting and tests. Run these locally before pushing your changes.  

4. **Celebrate Your Contribution!**  
   - Once your PR is merged, enjoy the satisfaction of contributing to an open-source project. 🎉

## 🧹 Code Style  

We strive to maintain clean, consistent, and readable code. Please follow these practices:  

- Run linters (`black`, `flake8`) before submitting your PR.  
- Include unit tests for new features or fixes where applicable.

## 📝 Notes  

- If you have ideas but aren’t sure how to implement them, feel free to open an issue just to discuss!  
- Don’t hesitate to ask questions if you’re stuck—collaboration is key.
